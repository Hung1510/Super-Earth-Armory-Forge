"""
The game-window input filter: a tiny x64 window procedure that the panel puts in front of
the game window's own while the game should get no input (the panel is open).

Helldivers 2 reads mouse movement through Windows raw input (the panel unregisters that),
but key presses, typed characters, mouse buttons and the wheel arrive as window messages.
This filter runs on the window's thread, without Lua:

  flag off  everything passes to the game's procedure; mouse button presses are noted
  flag on   key presses and typed characters are dropped (releases pass, so no key sticks);
            mouse button presses are dropped; a release passes only if the game saw its
            press; wheel turns are added up for the panel's own scrolling and dropped

6.3: with the flag on and the raw flag set, WM_INPUT (the game's raw mouse, when it is
registered from another thread and the panel can't take the registration back) is dropped
too: handed to DefWindowProcW so Windows can free it, never to the game.

Block (one 4 KB page, read / write / execute; the panel fills the data, the code is at +64):
  +0  u32 flag (bit 0 on, bit 1 also drop raw input)    +4  i32 wheel total (120 a notch, + = away from you)
  +8  u32 keys dropped     +12 u32 button presses / releases dropped
  +16 u64 previous procedure                +24 u64 CallWindowProcW
  +32 u32 buttons the game saw pressed (bit 0 left, 1 right, 2 middle, 3 X)
  +36 u32 raw input messages dropped        +40 u64 DefWindowProcW
  +48 u8[13] per message WM_LBUTTONDOWN + n: kind * 16 + button (kind 1 press, 2 release)
